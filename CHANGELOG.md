# Changelog

All notable changes to ChimeraMapR are recorded here. Version numbers follow
`APP_VERSION` in `chimera_functions.R`, which is the single source of truth
read by `app.R` and `chimera_cli.R`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-09

- Reworked `loh_chain_analysis.R` to handle long LOH tracts with crossovers,
  including CO-TERM / internal-CO classification at the single-peak level.
- Replaced Mclust GMM + RLE with a beta-binomial EM + Viterbi HMM for LOH
  calling; fixed the resulting namespace issue.
- Added LOH table display/output and LOH plots to each overview panel.
- Peak-fusion refactor (binary-only fusions, NA-peak filtering).
- Plot layout fixes.
- Added back the embedded gene-conversion rule and ASC bug fixes.
- Added depth calculation to help identify terminal deletions; peak-fusion
  fix.
- Fixed two event types over-extending their footprint on the chromosome.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-21

- First use of Whittaker-smoothed peak analysis.
- RDS download for the main graph and for peak/region plots (replacing
  oversized ggplot object downloads).
- Broke analysis functions out of `app.R` into `chimera_functions.R` so they
  can be sourced without Shiny (enables the CLI).
- Various interface and README updates.

Earlier versions (0.1.0–0.4.9) predate this changelog; see `git log` for
that history.
